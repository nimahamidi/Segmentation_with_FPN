# Segmentation with Feature Pyramid Netwrok (FPN)
This is a Keras implementation of a segmentation algorithm with a FPN structure, using ResNet backbone. 
## Proposed archtecture by Facebook
- The following is the architecture to do the segmentaion. 
- One backbone can be used while having several head for different purpose
- The FPN with ResNet backbone is strong enough to do segmentation, human pose detection and ...
